My name is Yashodhan. I am a master's student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. After completing my B.Tech. in 2022, I began working as a Software Engineer at a fintech company. As a fresher, I acquired a wide range of new skills and technologies, focusing particularly on data engineering. I contributed to the development of core aspects of the EMI Cards IT systems, aiming to reduce costs and enhance overall security and reliability.

## Watercoloring Journey

I am also a professional watercolor artist. On weekends, I enjoy plein air sessions, exploring fantastic facades, streets, and landscapes around me. Painting these subjects allows me to express my feelings and brings me a sense of joy and satisfaction. It also helps me excel in my career goals.

I taught myself to paint during the COVID-19 pandemic, using the extra time at home as an opportunity to develop my skills. Over the years, I have continued to work on my painting and cultivate my artistic sensibility. Although a busy work schedule has slowed my progress recently, I am still actively pursuing my passion. Here are some of my works—feel free to check out my Instagram for more paintings.
