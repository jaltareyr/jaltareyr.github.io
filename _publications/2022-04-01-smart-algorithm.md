In recent years, electric vehicles (EV) have gained tremendous popularity, and a lot of research is being carried out in this area, leading to a lot of available development opportunities. This has necessitated electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) that support fast charging. According to the new policies that are being announced, the number of electric vehicles is going to increase, highlighting the demand for efficient and smart electric vehicles. With this increase in demand, EVCS will require the improvement in the relevant technology to obtain better and efficient coordination among the increasing amount of EV and EVCS. It also engenders the need for a charging station design that requires minimal maintenance, minimal human intervention, and judicious use of the available power supplied by the power grid without disturbing steady-state stability. Technologies that meet the design requirements described above can be incorporated into an EVCS in this paper. To maximize the utilization of power at existing EV charging infrastructure, and to avoid overloading of system limits, smart charging algorithm has been designed. By analyzing the power demand of each EV connected to charging station, suitable power allocation is done based on priority flags marked to each EV continuously. This process happens independently without any external assistance. Finally results can be observed for improved power utilization at an existing charging infrastructure.
